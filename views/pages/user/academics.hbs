                            Warm greetings from Darul Irfan Islamic Academy! <br><br>
                            Darul Irfan Islamic Academy was founded in 2014 at Velluvangad, affiliated with Darul Huda

                            and applied together based on the contextual needs. We are honored and proud to have been a
                            torchbearer of an integrated education system at least in the eastern Eranad context by

                            sacred journey illuminated by the Quran and Sunnah. Beyond academics, we nurture the
                            holistic development of our students through vibrant extracurriculars, cultural
                            celebrations, and interfaith dialogues. These initiatives empower them to embrace their
                            unique identities while fostering respect and understanding for others. <br><br>
